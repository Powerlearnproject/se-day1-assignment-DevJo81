#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering invloves the development and maintenance of software products by applying engineering principles, methods and tools. It is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power different aspects of modern life such as communication, entertainment and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming languages such as C, having software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Involves creating high-level, detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Involves writing the code and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing: Conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance: Involves providing ongoing support, updates, enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall and agile methodologies are both software development methodologies that guide the software development process. The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (requirement, design, implementation) that flow downwards like a waterfall while the agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. The waterfall methodology for example can be used to develop a patient management system for a hospital because it has strict regulations and requires detailed documentation and rigorous testing before deployment. Agile methodology on the other hand can be used to develop a new e-commerce website for a startup since the project can benefit from flexibility, quick iterations and cutomer input.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes code and implement software solutions, A Quality Assuarance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans and a Project Manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for instance visual studio and eclipse. Version Control Sytems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers include changing requirements during the development cycle, having tight deadlines and pressure to deliver products on schedules that may result in rushed development and compromised quality and technical debts accured from shortcuts and can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. To overcome these challenges a software engineer can apply agile methodologies, effective communication, task prioritization and regular assessments of project goal and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is a critical aspect of Quality Assurance. Unit testing involves testing the individual components or modules of sofware, in Integration testing the interactions between different components or subsystems are tested, system testing involves testing the entire software system as whole and acceptance testing is tetsing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. The different types of testing are important to ensure that software products meet the specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to make AI models give the best possible responses. It is important in interacting with AI models because by making the questions more clear and specific it helps avoid getting confusing answers as the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example asking, "tell me about the universe" is a broad question that can be improved by asking, "give me a summary of the universe including its origin, structure and major components like galaxies and stars". The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies what exactly about the universe you need to know, it outlines the key aspects to cover such as the origin and structure and directly states what should be included avoiding vague words.
